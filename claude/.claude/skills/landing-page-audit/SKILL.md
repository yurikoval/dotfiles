# Landing Page Audit

Systematic conversion rate optimization analysis with prioritized recommendations.

## Process

1. **Capture the page** - URL or screenshot (note if only partial view)
2. **Evaluate above-the-fold** - First impression, clarity, CTA visibility
3. **Assess messaging** - Headline frameworks, copy quality, benefit focus
4. **Check trust signals** - Social proof, credibility markers
5. **Identify conversion killers** - Friction points, distractions
6. **Prioritize by impact** - High impact fixes first

## Headline Framework Evaluation

Test headlines against these proven frameworks:

| Framework | Structure | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **4U's** | Urgent + Unique + Useful + Ultra-specific | "Double Your Sales in 30 Days" |
| **AIDA** | Attention → Interest → Desire → Action | Pattern through page sections |
| **PAS** | Problem → Agitate → Solution | Lead with pain, twist knife, offer relief |
| **BAB** | Before → After → Bridge | Show transformation |

## Above-the-Fold Checklist

- [ ] Compelling headline with clear value proposition
- [ ] Supporting subheadline explaining "how"
- [ ] Hero image/video representing outcome (not just product)
- [ ] Primary CTA button (contrasting color, above fold)
- [ ] Trust signal (logo bar, rating, or testimonial)
- [ ] Minimal navigation (remove distracting links)

## CTA Placement Best Practices

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Hero section | Primary conversion, most visible |
| After value proposition | Reinforce after communicating value |
| After social proof | Convert after building trust |
| After features/benefits | Capture after educating |
| Sticky header/footer | Persistent access on long pages |

## Top 10 Conversion Killers

| Killer | Impact | Fix |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Slow page load (>3s) | 7% drop per second | Optimize images, CDN |
| Ad/landing mismatch | Trust destroyed | Match headlines |
| Unclear value prop | Confusion = bounce | Clarify headline |
| Competing CTAs | Decision paralysis | One primary CTA |
| Too many form fields | Friction | Reduce to essentials |
| No trust signals | Skepticism | Add proof |
| Poor mobile experience | 50%+ traffic lost | Responsive design |
| CTA below fold | Invisible | Move up |
| Visual clutter | Overwhelm | Simplify |
| Weak CTA copy | No motivation | Action verbs + value |

## Guidelines

- If only partial screenshot, note which sections couldn't be assessed
- Always provide specific rewrite suggestions, not just criticism
- Prioritize by impact × effort ratio
- Note if mobile assessment requires separate screenshot
- Never claim exact conversion lift percentages - use ranges
